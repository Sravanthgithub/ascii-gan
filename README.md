# ascii-gan

#### An ASCII GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of machine learning model that is used to generate new data samples that are similar to a training dataset. In the case of an ASCII GAN, the data samples are strings of ASCII characters, which are a standardized encoding system for representing text on computers.
